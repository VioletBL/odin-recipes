<h1>Latkes</h1>

<body>A latke is a type of potato pancake or fritter in Ashkenazi Jewish cuisine that is traditionally prepared to celebrate Hanukkah. Latkes can be made with ingredients other than potatoes such as cheese, onion and zucchini. </body>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 large Russet potatoes (about 1 pound), scrubbed and cut lengthwise into quarters</li>
    <li>1 large onion (8 ounces), peeled and cut into quarters</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons coarse kosher salt (or 1 teaspoon fine sea salt), plus more for sprinkling</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>Oil for frying</li>
</ul>
<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Using a food processor with a coarse grating disc, grate the potatoes and onion. Transfer the mixture to a clean dishtowel and squeeze and wring out as much of the liquid as possible.</li>
    <li>Working quickly, transfer the mixture to a large bowl. Add the eggs, flour, salt, baking powder and pepper, and mix until the flour is absorbed.</li>
    <li>In a medium heavy-bottomed pan over medium-high heat, pour in about ¼ inch of the oil. Once the oil is hot (a drop of batter placed in the pan should sizzle), use a heaping tablespoon to drop the batter into the hot pan, cooking in batches. Use a spatula to flatten and shape the drops into discs. When the edges of the latkes are brown and crispy, about 5 minutes, flip. Cook until the second side is deeply browned, about another 5 minutes. Transfer the latkes to a paper towel-lined plate to drain and sprinkle with salt while still warm. Repeat with the remaining batter.</li>
